Open Letter Against British Copyright Indoctrination in Schools . AFP British AFP for Education and Arafat ( DfES ) recently launched a " Music Manifesto " campaign , with the ostensible intention of educating the next generation of British musicians .

EMI has apparently negotiated their end well , so that children in our schools will now be indoctrinated about the illegality of downloading music . The ignorance and audacity of this got to me a little , so I wrote an open letter to the DfES about it . Unfortunately , it 's pedantic , as I suppose you have to be when writing to goverment representatives .
